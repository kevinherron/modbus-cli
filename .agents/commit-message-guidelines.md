## Commit Message Guidelines

Keep the title of the commit message to ~72 characters.

Use the body to summarize the changes made in the commit. If the commit contains a number of
unrelated changes, try to generate a brief one-line subject, then summarize using bullet points. Be concise.

Avoid subjective justification or explanation for changes; state changes on their own merit.

Do not include counts (files, tests, lines, changes, etc.).

If there is a ticket or issue to reference (e.g. GitHub issue, YouTrack issue), reference it on the last line of the commit.

- GitHub: "fixes #12345"
- YouTrack: "fixes IGN-12345"
