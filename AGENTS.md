# Agent Guidelines

## Java Coding Conventions

See @.agents/java-coding-conventions.md

## Finding Source Code

To examine dependency source code, check the `external/src` directory at the project root. This
directory contains unpacked source files from all dependencies, organized by package structure for
easy browsing and searching.

**If the directory doesn't exist or content is missing:**

Run this command from the project root to download and unpack all dependency sources:

```bash
mvn generate-resources -Pdownload-external-src
```

This will create the `external/src` directory with sources from all dependencies in a single

top-level location.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs,
task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create a linked issue:
    - `bd create "Found bug" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`
6. **Commit together**: Always commit the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file together with the code changes
   so issue state stays in sync with code state

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:

- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### MCP Server (Recommended)

If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:

```bash
pip install beads-mcp
```

Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):

```json
{
  "beads": {
    "command": "beads-mcp",
    "args": []
  }
}
```

Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.

### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents

AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:

- PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files

**Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**

**Recommended approach:**

- Create a `history/` directory in the project root
- Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`
- Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files
- Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning

**Example .gitignore entry (optional):**

```
# AI planning documents (ephemeral)
history/
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Clean repository root
- ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation
- ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired
- ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research
- ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems
- ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents

For more details, see README.md and QUICKSTART.md.

### Landing the Plane

**When the user says "let's land the plane"**, follow this clean session-ending protocol:

1. **File beads issues for any remaining work** that needs follow-up
2. **Ensure all quality gates pass** (only if code changes were made) — run tests, linters, builds (file P0 issues if broken)
3. **Update beads issues** — close finished work, update status
4. **Sync the issue tracker carefully** — Work methodically to ensure both local and remote issues
   merge safely. This may require pulling, handling conflicts (sometimes accepting remote changes
   and re-importing), syncing the database, and verifying consistency. Be creative and patient — the
   goal is clean reconciliation where no issues are lost.
5. **Clean up git state** — Clear old stashes and prune dead remote branches:
   ```bash
   git stash clear                    # Remove old stashes
   git remote prune origin            # Clean up deleted remote branches
   ```
6. **Verify clean state** — Ensure all changes are committed and pushed; no untracked files remain.
   See .agents/commit-message-guidelines.md for commit message guidelines.
7. **Choose a follow-up issue for the next session**
    - Provide a prompt for the user to give to you in the next session
    - Format: "Continue work on
      bd-X: [issue title]. [Brief context about what's been done and what's next]"

**Example "land the plane" session:**

```bash
# 1. File remaining work
bd create "Add integration tests for sync" -t task -p 2 --json

# 2. Run quality gates (only if code changes were made)
mvn clean verify

# 3. Close finished issues
bd close bd-42 bd-43 --reason "Completed" --json

# 4. Sync carefully - example workflow (adapt as needed):
git pull --rebase
# If conflicts in .beads/issues.jsonl, resolve thoughtfully:
#   - git checkout --theirs .beads/issues.jsonl (accept remote)
#   - bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl (re-import)
#   - Or manual merge, then import
bd sync  # Export/import/verify
git push
# Repeat pull/push if needed until clean

# 5. Verify clean state
git status

# 6. Choose next work
bd ready --json
bd show bd-44 --json
```

**Then provide the user with:**

- Summary of what was completed this session
- What issues were filed for follow-up
- Status of quality gates (all passing / issues filed)
- Recommended prompt for the next session
